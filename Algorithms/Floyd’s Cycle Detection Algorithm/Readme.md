# Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
- The algorithm detects loop in linked list if there is. In here algorithm will be explained basically. If you want to reach source code of algorithm which is written with C programming language, you can click [here](https://github.com/MertPehlivancik/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/LinkedList) and download linked list source code. After that you can call "linked_list_detect_loop_with_FloydCycleFindingAlgorithm" function.
- If you preper, you can read this document at [Turkish](Readme.tr.md).
