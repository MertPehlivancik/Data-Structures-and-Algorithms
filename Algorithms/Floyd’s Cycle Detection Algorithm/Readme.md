#Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
-The algorithm detects loop in linked list if there is. In here algorithm will be explained basically. If you want to reach source code of algorithm which is written with C programming language, you can click here() and download linked list source code. After that you can call "linked_list_detect_loop_with_FloydCycleFindingAlgorithm" function.
